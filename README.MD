#Jackie Minieri Fashion Website

### Summary

* I am creating a portfolio website for a local fashion designer who specializes in marine life designs.

*For the front end, I am using Materialize.  On the back end, I am using Handlebars to set up the app for future use with a database (where the clothes can be stored as products), Node.js to connect to the MySQL database and Express to handle routing.
