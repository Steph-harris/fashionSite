    <p class="flow-text">
      Fashion never stops. There is always the new project, the new opportunity. Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them. I think it's an old fashioned notion that fashion needs to be exclusive to be fashionable. Dressing is a way of life. I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.</p>
      
      <p class="flow-text">I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, 'Marc Jacobs!' in a French accent. I never look at other people's work. My mind has to be completely focused on my own illusions. I wish I had invented blue jeans. They have expression, modesty, sex appeal, simplicity - all I hope for in my clothes. My breakfast is very important. Delete the negative; accentuate the positive!

        <p>I am a very simple card. I am good at containing small bits of information.
        I am convenient because I require little markup to use effectively. I am similar to what is called a panel in other frameworks.
